            <h4>Server Logfiles</h4>

            <p>When accessing our website, the type and version of the browser used are transmitted by the respective
                Internet browser and stored in log files, the so-called server log files. The IP addresses of the users are
                deleted or made anonymous after the end of their use. In the case of anonymisation, the IP addresses are
                changed in such a way that the individual details about personal or factual circumstances cannot be
                allocated to a specific or identifiable natural person, or can only be allocated with a disproportionately
                large expenditure of time, money and labour. This usage data forms the basis for statistical, anonymous
                evaluations in order to improve our website and make it more user-friendly. This data is not merged with
                other data sources. </p>

                data about the use of our websites. We use cookies and similar technologies to provide you with products and
                services, manage our marketing, and provide a safe online experience, measure the performance of our

            <h4>Google Analytics</h4>

            <p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google
                Analytics uses cookies to help you analyse how users use the website. The information generated by the
                cookie about your use of the website will generally be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the
                United States. However, if IP anonymisation is activated on this website, your IP address will be shortened
                by Google in advance within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the
                Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted
                to a Google server in the USA where it will be shortened. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google
                will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to
                provide other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website operator. The IP
                address offered by Google Analytics within the framework of Google Analytics is not combined with other
                Google data. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser,
                however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.
                You can also prevent Google from collecting the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the

                https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/. We would like to point out that on this website Google Analytics
                has been extended by the code "anonymizeIp" in order to guarantee anonymous collection of IP addresses
                (so-called IP masking).</p>

        <div class="data-container">

            <h4>Google reCaptcha</h4>

            <p>In order to protect your requests via the Internet form, the reCaptcha service of Google Inc. (Google) is
                used. The query serves to differentiate whether the input is made by a human being or whether it is misused
                by automated, mechanical processing. The query includes sending the IP address and any other data required
                by Google for the reCaptcha service to Google. For this purpose your input will be transmitted to Google and
                used there. By using reCaptcha, you agree that the recognition you provide will be incorporated into the
                digitisation of old works. However, if IP anonymisation is activated on this website, Google will previously
                shorten your IP address within member states of the European Union or in other signatory states to the
                Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted
                to and truncated by Google on servers in the United States. On behalf of the operator of this website,
                Google will use this information to evaluate your use of this service. The IP address transmitted by your
                browser as part of reCaptcha is not merged with other data from Google. These data are subject to the
                differing data protection regulations of Google. For more information about Google's privacy policy, please

            <h4>Google Maps</h4>

            <p>On our website we use Google Maps (API) from Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043,
                USA ("Google"). Google Maps is a web service that displays interactive (land) maps to visually represent
                geographic information. Using this service will show you our location and make it easier for you to get
                there. Already when you call up the subpages in which the Google Maps map is integrated, information about
                your use of our website (e.g. your IP address) is transferred to Google's servers in the USA and stored
                there. This takes place regardless of whether Google provides a user account that you are logged in to or
                whether there is no user account. If you are logged in at Google, your data will be directly assigned to
                your account. If you do not want your profile to be associated with Google, you must log out before
                activating the button. Google stores your data (even for users who are not logged in) as usage profiles and
                evaluates them. In particular, such evaluation is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit.f DSGVO
                on the basis of Google's legitimate interests in the display of personalised advertising, market research
                and/or the design of its website to meet needs. You have the right to object to the creation of these user
                profiles, and you must contact Google to exercise this right. Google LLC, headquartered in the USA, is
                certified for the us-European data protection agreement "Privacy Shield", which guarantees compliance with
                the data protection level applicable in the EU. If you do not agree with the future transmission of your
                data to Google within the framework of the use of Google Maps, you also have the option of completely
                deactivating the Google Maps web service by deactivating the JavaScript application in your browser. Google
                Maps and thus also the map display on this website can then not be used. </p>

                found here: https://developers.google.com/+/plugins.When you visit our website that contains such a button,
                your browser connects directly to Google's servers. The content of the Google+ button is transmitted by
                Google directly to your browser and integrated into the website by it. According to Google, no personally
                identifiable information is collected without a click on the "+1" button. Only for logged in members, such
                data, including the IP address, is collected, transmitted to a Google server in the U.S. and stored and
                processed there. We would like to point out that we do not know the content of the transmitted data and its
                use by Google. For the purpose and scope of data collection and further processing and use of the data by
                Google, as well as your rights and settings to protect your privacy, please refer to Google's privacy
                policy: http://www.google.com/intl/de/+/policy/+1button.html.If you do not want Google to link information
